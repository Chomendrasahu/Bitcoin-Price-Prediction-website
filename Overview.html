    <li><p style="font-size:160%;">Linear Regression:-<br>
        <br>
        Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. Itâ€™s among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results. Linear regression is one of the fundamental statistical and machine learning techniques.

    <li><p style="font-size:160%;">K-Nearest Neighbour:-<br>
        <br>
        The k-nearest neighbour's algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
        KNN works by calculating the distances between a query and all of the examples in the data, then selecting the number of examples (K) closest to the query and voting for the most frequent label (in the case of classification) or averaging the labels (in the case of regression).

    <li><p style="font-size:160%;">Long Short-Term Memory :-<br>
        <br>
        It is a special kind of neural network that is capable of learning long term dependencies in data. This is achieved because the recurring module of the model has a combination of four layers interacting with each other.An LSTM has a cell state and three gates which provides them with the power to selectively learn,unlearn or retain information from each of the units.
